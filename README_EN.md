## üåê Project Overview

**Bothub Nexus** is a comprehensive **monitoring and notification system** designed to track activities across multiple platforms, including **GitHub**, **Dev.to**, and **Blue Sky**. By fetching data from these platforms via their APIs, it processes and broadcasts notifications to a **Telegram bot**. The project is built using **TypeScript** and leverages a variety of libraries and services to provide real-time monitoring and posting capabilities.

## üîë Key Features

### GitHub Monitoring

- Monitors notifications and repositories for the authenticated user.
- Fetches recent releases from repositories.
- Emits events for new notifications and repositories.

### Dev.to Monitoring

- Fetches posts for the specified user.
- Iterates over each post and checks if it was recently published using `calculateDiffHours`.
- Emits events for newly published posts.

### Blue Sky Posting

- Posts updates to Blue Sky via the **`/post`** command in Telegram.
- Authenticates with Blue Sky using user credentials.
- Broadcasts messages to Telegram upon successful posting.

### Telegram Bot Integration

- Receives commands and messages from users.
- Posts to **Blue Sky** via **Telegram** using the `/post` command.
- Broadcasts notifications and updates to configured chat IDs.
- Supports localization for **English** and **Portuguese**.

### Localization

**Bothub Nexus** supports localization in **English** and **Portuguese** via **i18next**. Translation files are located in the `locales` directory, and the localization settings are initialized in `i18n.ts`.

## üõ† Technical Details

### Configuration

Bothub Nexus uses **environment variables** to manage configuration settings. These settings are loaded from a `.env` file using the **dotenv** package. The configuration includes API keys, usernames, and other credentials necessary for the services being monitored.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Initialization

- Loads environment settings from the `.env` file.
- Initializes the Telegram bot and sets up event listeners for monitoring activities on **GitHub** and **Dev.to**.

### Monitoring

- **GitHub** and **Dev.to** monitoring tasks are scheduled to run at specific intervals using **node-cron**.
- The monitoring functions fetch data from their respective APIs and emit events for any new activities.

### Event Handling

- Event listeners capture these emitted events and broadcast messages to the **Telegram bot**.
- The **Telegram bot** handles incoming messages and executes commands such as posting updates to **Blue Sky** via the `/post` command.
- Any errors during API requests are logged and can be broadcasted to the Telegram bot for real-time tracking.

## üïí Cron Scheduling

The project uses **cron jobs** to schedule monitoring tasks. The following job is scheduled to run daily at **7 AM**:

```javascript
cron.schedule('0 7 * * *', async () => {
    console.log('Starting daily monitoring at 7 AM...');
    await monitorReleases(); // Or monitorNotifications
    console.log('Monitoring completed.');
});
```

## How to Run

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bothub-nexus.git
cd bothub-nexus
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create and configure .env file: Add your API tokens and keys to the .env file:

```ini
# Telegram bot authentication token
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN

# Chat IDs that will receive notifications on Telegram (comma-separated if more than one)
TELEGRAM_CHAT_IDS=YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_IDS

# Blue Sky account username
BLUESKY_USERNAME=YOUR_BLUESKY_USERNAME

# Blue Sky account password
BLUESKY_PASSWORD=YOUR_BLUESKY_PASSWORD

# GitHub authentication token for API access
GITHUB_TOKEN=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN

# GitHub username
GITHUB_USERNAME=YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME

# Dev.to API key
DEV_TO_API_KEY=YOUR_DEVTO_API_KEY

# Dev.to username
DEV_TO_USERNAME=YOUR_DEVTO_USERNAME
```

Start the project:

```bash
npm start
```

Once running, Bothub Nexus will monitor activities across platforms and send notifications to the configured Telegram bot. You can also use the /post (message) command to post updates to Blue Sky.

## üì± Usage

Interact with the Telegram bot using the following commands:

```bash
/start: Initialize the bot and start receiving notifications.
/post (message): Posts the specified message to Blue Sky and sends a success confirmation to Telegram.
```

The bot will automatically monitor and notify about:

- GitHub notifications and releases.
- Dev.to posts.
